# Cuisine-recommendation-system-using-C 
This code is a simple program for managing and recommending cuisines. The given code is a simple program for managing and recommending cuisines. It allows two roles: "Manager" and "Customer." The manager can add cuisines to a file, while the customer can filter and recommend cuisines based on their preferences. The code uses a linked list data structure to store the cuisines. The Cuisine struct represents a cuisine and contains fields for name, description, region, and pointers to the previous and next cuisines. The global variable head points to the head of the linked list. The program provides several functions to perform different operations. The insertEnd function inserts a new cuisine at the end of the linked list. The displayCuisines function displays all the cuisines in the list. The recommendCuisines function reads cuisines from a file and recommends them based on filter criteria. The deallocateCuisines function frees the memory allocated for the linked list. The manager function is executed when the role is set to 1. It asks for a username and password, verifies them, and then asks for the number of cuisines to add. It reads the details of each cuisine, writes them to a file, and inserts them into the linked list. Finally, it displays all the cuisines. The customer function is executed when the role is set to 2. It asks for a filter option and reads the corresponding input. Based on the filter option, it asks for additional inputs (preference and/or region) and calls the recommendCuisines function to display the recommended cuisines. The main function is the entry point of the program. It repeatedly asks for the user's role (manager, customer, or exit) and executes the corresponding function. It continues until the user chooses to exit. Finally, it deallocates the cuisines and exits the program.
